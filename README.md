Data analysis performed in Python 3 primarily on *jupyter* notebooks. 

Datasets are not stored on github due to file size limitations.

Web scraping to collect NIH disease categories and description links is detailed in [genediseasedata-original](https://github.com/dbricare/genediseaselink-data/blob/master/genediseasedata-original.ipynb).

Visualization work is detailed in [genediseasedata-visualize](https://github.com/dbricare/genediseaselink-data/blob/master/genediseasedata-visualize.ipynb).

New features planned include:
- continuous updating of the database to include the most recent results from literature,
